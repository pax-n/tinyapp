## Using TinyApp

#### Register/Login

Users must be logged in to create new links, view them, and edit them.

Users will be given a notice to login or register upon visiting.

#### Create New Links

Click Create New URL on navigation bar at the top.

This will then bring you to a page where you can shorten any url of your liking.

#### Edit or Delete Short Links

In My URLs, you can edit or delete any link you want.

Upon clicking edit, you will be directed to the shortURL page where you can edit your long url.

#### Sharable link

The path to use any short link is /u/:shortURL. This will redirect you to the long URL.

Make sure not to be using /url/:shortURL because this will redirect you to the edit page.

Clicking on the corresponding shortURL will direct you to the website.
